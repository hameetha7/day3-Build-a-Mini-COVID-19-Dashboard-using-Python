This dashboard visualizes a subset of WHO COVID-19 data for 10 countries, focusing on India as an example. 
The visualizations include daily new cases, weekly deaths, and a pie chart comparing total deaths to estimated recoveries. 
From the graphs, we can observe daily and weekly trends, spot peaks or declines, and estimate the relative burden of deaths versus recoveries. 
These insights help understand the progression and current status of COVID-19 in a specific country.
